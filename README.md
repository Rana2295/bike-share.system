# bike-share.system Analysis
Overview:

Data Analysis using Python and pandas

In my project, I analysed data of bike-share systems for three major cities in the
United States. Chicago, New York City, and Washington. In an interactive experience, the user chooses to filter the data by city first, then to filter again according to a certain month or day. by computing some descriptive statistics, the user gets some interesting information, which is 
easy to understand as below:

• most common month
• most common day of the week
• most common hour of the day
• most common start station
• most common end station
• most common trip from start to end (i.e., most frequent combination of start station
and end station)
• total travel time
• average travel time
• counts of each user type
• counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)
• the ages and years of birth for the youngest, oldest, and the average user

In the end, the user can restart his filtration again and choose another options.
He also can choose how many rows to view.

Bike Share Data:

Over the past decade, bicycle-sharing systems have grown in number and popularity in cities.
Bikes are borrowed from stations that are pointed in different locations. People can borrow the bicycle to take them from one location to another or to come back again for the same station. Once they arrive at their target location, they can park the bike in its station and pay for their ride. This system facilities transportation in an easy and affordable way. Each bike can serve several people per day.

data was provided by “Motivate”, a bike share system provider for many major cities in the
United States.
